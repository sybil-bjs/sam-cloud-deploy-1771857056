## 1:00 AM: Learning + Self-Improvement Review (Cron)
- Reviewed Feb 21 work: major cron audit + Agent Trigger Words guide creation
- **Key operational issues identified:**
  - All 12 cron jobs failed with "model not allowed: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" → fixed with "sonnet" alias
  - Conversation sync missing daytime data (--hours 6, 1x/day) → fixed with 3x daily schedule
  - A2A daemon registration lost after Railway relay restarts → requires manual restart to re-register
  - Memory Guardian produced 6 false positives from pattern matching without context
- **Client interaction insights:**
  - Agent user guides must be completely non-technical (no file paths, tool names, jargon)
  - Users describe desired outcomes, agent handles implementation details
  - Public-facing documentation needs generic examples (no client-specific names)
- **What worked:** Clear iterative feedback process with Bridget, comprehensive cron audit, full data backfill
- **What needs improvement:** Memory Guardian tuning, email delivery verification, A2A auto-recovery
- **Created learning entry:** INS-20260222-001 (Memory Guardian false positives)
- Most findings scored 0.2-0.25 on surprise-score (below 0.4 threshold) but operationally critical### A2A ← Santos — 12:42 🔴
