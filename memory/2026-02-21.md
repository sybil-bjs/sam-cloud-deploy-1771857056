## Midnight: Context Pruning Enabled
- Applied `cache-ttl` with `20m` TTL (Bridget approved Feb 20)
- Config: `contextPruning: { mode: "cache-ttl", ttl: "20m" }`

## 4:00-7:00 AM: Cron Fix & Sybil Audit (with Bridget)
- All 12 cron jobs failed overnight — `model not allowed: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- Fixed all jobs: updated model from `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` → `sonnet` (alias)
- Click Seguros Daily Report upgraded to `opus` for quality (Bridget's call)
- Manually triggered Nightly Report, Click Seguros Report, Learning Extraction — all succeeded on `sonnet`
- Audited all pending Sybil A2A tasks (50+ messages in inbox):
  - Applied: Field security addendum to SOUL.md (prompt injection defense, credential protection)
  - Skipped (Bridget will discuss with Sybil): auto-indexer, A2A task protocol, memory standard, etc.
  - Flagged: some tasks tried to add overhead to heartbeat or give Sybil's tasks top priority over client work
- Restarted A2A daemon — re-registered with relay, picked up 8 queued messages, WebSocket confirmed working
- Root cause of A2A delivery failures: agent ID registration lost after relay (Railway) restarts
- No push access to relay repo (BJS-Innovation-Lab/A2A-BJS-INTERNAL-SKILL) — Johan or Sybil needed

## 6:21 AM: Learning Extraction (Cron Job)
- Reviewed yesterday's significant operational work
- Extracted key learnings using surprise-score analysis
- **Created learning entries:**
  - COR-20260221-001: Client priority clarification (Click Seguros, Sara, Suzanne vs team leads)
  - INS-20260221-001: Workspace contamination from agent transitions 
  - INS-20260221-002: API rate limits causing cron job failures, solved with 1-hour spacing
  - OUT-20260221-001: Successful context pruning implementation
- Most insights scored 0.25-0.38 on surprise-score (below 0.4 threshold) but were operationally critical

## 6:50 AM: Conversation Sync Fixed
- Ran sync-conversations.cjs manually — uploaded 235 messages from 6 sessions to Supabase
- Sync cron job (4 AM) was failing with model error like everything else
- Now fixed on `sonnet`, will auto-run tonight

## 7:00-11:00 AM: Agent Trigger Words Guide (with Bridget)
- Created comprehensive "Agent Trigger Words" user guide — 72 entries, 17 categories

- Rewrote File Operations, GitHub/Code, Web/Research, Scheduling, Tools, Control sections
- Created condensed "Cheat Sheet" version (65 entries) for public website
- Both published to Notion under BJS LABS
- Notion API integrated — key stored at ~/.config/notion/api_key

## 6:30 PM: Memory Guardian Scan
- All 6 findings were false positives (pattern matching without context)
- "You are Sybil" was just notes about Bridget's feedback, not identity attack
- Need to tune guardian sensitivity

## 7:00 PM: Click Seguros Daily Report
- First successful run on Opus — clean output
- Weekend = zero client activity (expected)

- Bridget shared Google Sheet with 40+ agent skills (prompts from Sybil + Santos)
- Asked for my field agent perspective as a new column
- Sub-agent wrote 54 skill perspectives to reports/skills-field-perspective.md
- Mexican business context: SAT/CFDI, WhatsApp-first, cultural nuances
- Can't write to Google Sheets — gog CLI not authed for sheets, need Bridget to paste CSV or grant editor access

## 11:30 PM: Rate Limits Hit

- Conversation Sync, Nightly Report both rate-limited
- Learning + Self-Improvement ran successfully at 1 AM (limits recovered)

  - GitHub/Code → "Website Changes": non-technical users describe what they see
  - Scheduling: no cron IDs or model names — just "every day at [time]"
  - Removed: 1Password, run a script, system updates, HEARTBEAT_OK
