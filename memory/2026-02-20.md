## Morning Session with Bridget (~5-10 AM)

### Cron Job Overhaul ✅
- Confirmed no middle-of-night auto-update jobs
- Found 4 cron jobs failing overnight due to **API rate limits** — caused by jobs stacking + interactive session competing for quota
- **Spaced all nightly jobs 1 hour apart** (midnight-5 AM):
  - 12 AM: Nightly Report
  - 1 AM: Learning Extraction
  - 2 AM: Self-Improvement Review
  - 3 AM: (OpenClaw Auto-Update — now DISABLED for field agents)
  - 3:30 AM: Thread Archival
  - 4 AM: Conversation + Memory Sync
  - 5 AM: Memory API Refresh (reduced from 3x/day to 1x/day — saves ~30K tokens/day)
- **Updated all 11 cron jobs to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`** (was `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- Added `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` to gateway config
- Removed Boot Memory Freshness Check from HEARTBEAT.md (redundant)
- Added **Memory Guardian Scan** cron at 6:30 PM CT

### Context Pruning — Approved for Tonight
- Bridget approved enabling `cache-ttl` context pruning
- Set to `20m` TTL (better for frontend/build work vs Saber's 15m)
- Reminder set for midnight tonight to apply

### Client Focus Clarified
- My main clients: **Click Seguros, Sara, and Suzanne** (not Johan/Bridget)
- Vulkimi is set up, not my responsibility
- Research tasks cleared — taken off research duty

### A2A Reconnected ✅
- Old daemon had wrong config (Sybil's agent ID instead of mine!)
- Cloned fresh A2A skill from BJS-Innovation-Lab/skills repo
- Created proper config.json with correct UUID
- Daemon running, **connected successfully**
- Added A2A health check + inbox check to HEARTBEAT.md
- 4 messages from Sybil received

### Suzanne Quick Message (~9:38 AM)
- Asked about Julian's Figma access — told her I don't have it

### Workspace & Files Cleanup (afternoon)
- Cleaned all 9 `memory/core/` files — were full of Sybil's data (research, StorybookRetro, etc.)
- Rewrote MEMORY.md from scratch — was mangled with truncated sentences
- Deleted ~80+ files/folders from workspace that were Sybil's (all sent to trash, recoverable)
- Updated USER.md with full team + client contacts
- Updated IDENTITY.md — fixed language info, generated avatar (multi-tool mascot)
- Cleaned AGENTS.md — removed bloated heartbeat section, Memory API first-turn refresh, stale instructions
- Added immediate write rule to AGENTS.md
- Heartbeat changed to 30 min (was default 60 min)


### Pre-Compaction Snapshot (2026-02-20 01:00:35 UTC)
_Saved before context compaction to prevent memory loss._
